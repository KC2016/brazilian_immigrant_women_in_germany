# Brazilian Immigrant Women in Germany: Descriptive Analysis and Data Visualization

Welcome to the data analysis project focused on Brazilian immigrant women in Germany. This project delves into the profiles, preferences, and services desired and offered by this unique demographic. In collaboration with Ligia Fascioni, a UX designer, I present a comprehensive examination based on a dataset derived from a survey conducted between 3/12/2024 and 12/12/2024.


### Purpose

The primary objective of this analysis is to delve into the preferences and requirements of Brazilian women in Germany concerning services. By categorizing and comparing the desired and offered services, our aim is to identify potential gaps and alignments. The ultimate goal is to assess the viability of creating a dedicated tool, such as an app or portal, that could facilitate the exchange of services among this community.


### Dataset
The dataset was curated through a meticulous reading and classification of responses to a 14-question survey distributed via Google Form. Responses were collected through LinkedIn posts, WhatsApp groups, and collaboration with relevant organizations.

### Approach
This analysis involves data cleaning, wrangling, and classification, with a particular focus on the challenges posed by open-ended responses. I utilized tools such as Google Sheets, Excel, and Python (Pandas and Jupyter Notebook) for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

The services were categorized into 19 groups, and the rates of desired categories were compared with those of the offered categories.

### Challenges
Classifying services proved to be a challenging task, given the variety of responses. I encountered instances of detailed stories and venting, requiring manual classification. Despite the challenges, the insights gained are valuable for understanding the nuances of service preferences.

### Tools used
- Google Sheets and Google Docs
- Excel
- Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

Through a combination of these tools, I was able to streamline the analysis process and present our findings visually using Excel for data visualization and dashboards.

### Main outcomes

#### About the women
> As expected,  the majority of these women **relocated to be with their partners or spouses**, reflecting the significant role of familial ties in migration decisions.

>The majority of respondents **made the move to Germany within the past year**, indicating a recent influx of Brazilian women to the country.

> **Berlin** stands out as the preferred city, hosting the largest population of Brazilian women, closely followed by **Hamburg**.

> Unsurprisingly, language emerges as a significant barrier, with many respondents having **elementary or basic proficiency in German**.

> Approximately 46% of them **had a previous residence in a country other than Germany**.

> Roughly 62% **exclusively hold Brazilian citizenship** and do not possess European citizenship.


#### About the services
> Health and aesthetics emerge as the top preferences among the desired service categories, while jobs & business and social services stand out as the most relevant in the offerings.

> The most sought-after category is health, which interestingly isn't prominently featured among the available services. However, social services and aesthetics, both highly desired, are well-represented in the offerings.

> It's notable that many women highlight a lack of certain attributes in the available services in Germany. They express a need for services that are empathetic, connected, and kind (in Portuguese). Additionally, there is a strong demand for high-quality, accessible online, child-friendly, extended-hour, personalized, and modern services, indicating areas where the current offerings may fall short of meeting these preferences

### Conclusions

The findings underscore the potential for a dedicated tool to facilitate service exchange among Brazilian women in Germany. Addressing language barriers, focusing on high-demand categories like health and aesthetics, and acknowledging the unique attributes desired by the community could contribute to the success of such a platform. Additionally, understanding the demographic composition, including previous foreign residences and citizenship status, provides valuable context for designing and implementing the tool effectively.
