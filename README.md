# Brazilian Immigrant Women in Germany:
## Descriptive Analysis and Data Visualization

Welcome to the data analysis project focused on Brazilian immigrant women in Germany. This project delves into the profiles, preferences, and services desired and offered by this unique demographic. In collaboration with Ligia Fascioni, a UX designer, I present a comprehensive examination based on a dataset derived from a survey conducted between 3/12/2024 and 12/12/2024.

### Objectives

My primary goal is to understand the intersection between the services offered by these women and the demand for desired services. Through a meticulous analysis of 156 survey responses, I provide insights into the characteristics of these women and the spectrum of services they seek and provide.


### The dataset
The dataset was curated through a meticulous reading and classification of responses to a 14-question survey distributed via Google Form. Responses were collected through LinkedIn posts, WhatsApp groups, and collaboration with relevant organizations.

### Methodology
This analysis involves data cleaning, wrangling, and classification, with a particular focus on the challenges posed by open-ended responses. I utilized tools such as Google Sheets, Excel, and Python (Pandas and Jupyter Notebook) for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

### Challenges
Classifying services proved to be a challenging task, given the variety of responses. I encountered instances of detailed stories and venting, requiring manual classification. Despite the challenges, the insights gained are valuable for understanding the nuances of service preferences.

### Tools used
- Google Sheets and Google Docs
- Excel
- Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

Through a combination of these tools, I was able to streamline the analysis process and present our findings visually using Excel for data visualization and dashboards.

### Key results
As expected,  m a majority of these women relocated to be with their partners or spouses, reflecting the significant role of familial ties in migration decisions.

The majority of respondents made the move to Germany within the past year, indicating a recent influx of Brazilian women to the country.

Berlin stands out as the preferred city, hosting the largest population of Brazilian women, closely followed by Hamburg.

Unsurprisingly, language emerges as a significant barrier, with many respondents having elementary or basic proficiency in German.
